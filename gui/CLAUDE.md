## Project Overview

This is a **Nostr client** built with **SvelteKit (Svelte 5) + Tailwind CSS** that enforces **NIP-13 Proof-of-Work mining** for all notes. Key architectural decisions:

- **Client-side only** - No backend server required
- **Applesauce** for Nostr protocol integration (applesauce-core, applesauce-relay, applesauce-signers)
- **@notemine/wrapper** for PoW mining
- **Dexie.js** for IndexedDB persistence
- **NIP-66** for discovering PoW-compatible relays

## Key Architecture Components

### 1. Relay Discovery System
- Queries `kind: 30166` events with `#R pow` tag to find PoW-compatible relays
- Maintains relay connection health and metadata

### 2. Mining Queue System
- All notes must be mined before publishing
- Mining continues in background if user navigates away
- Progress persisted to IndexedDB for resumption

### 3. Decay-Based Feed Ranking
- Notes decay based on age (configurable decay rate)
- Cumulative PoW from replies/mentions adds weight
- Zaps contribute to ranking but not decay prevention

### 4. Event Subscription Architecture
- Subscribes to: kind 1 (notes), kind 1111 (comments), mentions, zaps
- Real-time updates via Applesauce subscriptions
- Efficient batching and deduplication

## Development Guidelines

### State Management
- Use Svelte 5 runes (`$state`, `$derived`, `$effect`)
- Store relay connections in a central store
- Mining queue should be reactive and persistent

### UI/UX Principles
- Interface reveals itself as data arrives (progressive disclosure)
- Note opacity fades with age/decay
- Mining progress visible in UI
- Single-page app with dynamic sections

### Data Persistence Strategy
- **IndexedDB (via Dexie)**: Mining queue, nonce progress, relay metadata
- **LocalStorage**: User preferences (decay rate, PoW thresholds)
- **SessionStorage**: Temporary UI state

### Testing Approach
- Unit tests for mining logic and decay calculations
- Integration tests for relay discovery
- E2E tests for critical user flows

## NIP-13 Implementation Details

All events must include a `nonce` tag with format: `["nonce", "<nonce_value>", "<difficulty>"]`

Example mined event:
```json
{
  "kind": 1,
  "tags": [["nonce", "123456", "21"]],
  "content": "Hello Nostr!",
  "created_at": 1700000000,
  "pubkey": "...",
  "id": "000000..."
}
```

## Relay Communication Patterns

Use Applesauce's subscription model:
```javascript
// Subscribe to PoW notes
const sub = applesauce.subscribe({
  kinds: [1, 1111],
  '#nonce': ['*'] // Only events with nonce tags
});
```

# **Final High-Level Design Document (HLDD)**

*Nostr Client with NIP-13 Mining, Decay-Based Feed, Applesauce Integration, and Tailwind UI*

## **1. Software Architecture**

### **Overview**

This is a fully client-side **SvelteKit (Svelte 5) + Tailwind CSS** application that enforces **NIP-13 mining** for all visible and produced notes. It integrates with Nostr using **Applesauce**, a modern client library. The app discovers PoW-compatible relays using **NIP-66 (30166 events)** filtered by `#R pow`, and only displays **kind 1 events** and their **children** (threads, mentions, zaps).

A **Strfry-based custom relay** enforces **minimum PoW values per kind**, ensuring quality and consistency.

---

## **2. Component Breakdown**

### **Relay Discovery (NIP-66)**

* Filters `30166` events by `#R pow` to discover PoW relays.
* Fetches metadata and liveness using Applesauce.

### **Nostr Integration with Applesauce**

* Uses **Applesauce** ecosystem for all relay communication and signing operations.
* Handles subscriptions to kind 1, 1111, and reaction events (including zaps).

### **Mining Engine**

* Uses `@notemine/wrapper` to mine events with NIP-13 `nonce` tags.
* Mining resumes on revisit using persisted nonce data in IndexedDB.

### **Decay Engine**

* Weights each note using:

  * Age-based decay.
  * Cumulative PoW (replies, mentions).
  * Zaps (for ranking, not decay).
* Allows per-user decay rate tuning via UI.

### **Strfry-Based Relay**

* Enforces PoW thresholds at the relay level.
* Configurable per-kind PoW minimums.
* Public policy, discoverable via NIP-66.

### **Reactive UI (SvelteKit + Tailwind)**

* Single-page app layout.
* Dynamic interface that reveals itself as data arrives.
* Note visibility fades with age (opacity-based).
* Mining queue visualized in UI.
* Global and per-kind PoW controls.

### Implementation Notes

1. **Architecture**: Use a modular approach where each system (tiling, animation, etc.) is independent but interconnected through events.

2. **Performance**: Prioritize CSS transforms and will-change for smooth animations. Use ResizeObserver and IntersectionObserver for efficient updates.

3. **Compatibility**: Ensure graceful degradation for browsers without certain features (e.g., backdrop-filter for blur).

4. **Testing**: Create visual regression tests for layout algorithms and animation timing.

5. **Documentation**: Document each Hyprland feature implementation with examples and configuration options.
